# Random walker with straight lines 

[visualization](https://www.lorismat.com/work/random-walker)  

The program here is starting from the middle of the canvas. From this point, a line of a random size is drawn, then shift from 90 degrees and another one is drawn. And so on. These lines are drawn with a fixed color or a random color from a palette.
