# Anarchic mosaic

[visualization](https://www.lorismat.com/work/mosaic)  

Data has been randomly generated to create a mosaic pattern with a few set of rules, line by line, on a specific dimension. Playing with color scales and the HSB notation, it becomes easier to process random set of color tones (dark green, dark red here). Also, the size of every square has been randomly created within a specific range.
