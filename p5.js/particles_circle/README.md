# Shaping particles in circle

[visualization](https://www.lorismat.com/work/particles)  

p5.js makes it convenient to work with particle systems. Circle shapes are designed here with some hacks or formulas. For the first two figures, a particle system is designed in the full frame, and an additional white layer is added to cover the desired areas. Not really technical then. 

The third particle system, although not much technical either, is deliberately composed of particles starting around a circle. Their starting point is then given by the parametric equation of the circle. Particles are then free to go in any direction, up to the end of the frame.
