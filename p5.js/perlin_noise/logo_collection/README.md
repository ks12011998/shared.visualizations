# Logo design with _Perlin_ noise

The idea of this small collection is to explore Perlin noise with `p5.js` to design animated logos.  

Many shapes are inspired by code snippets and videos from [Daniel Shiffman's coding challenges](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/) on Perlin noise which I likely recommend, including:  

- [BLOBBY!](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/036-blobby.html)
- [Perlin noise flow field](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/024-perlinnoiseflowfield.html)
- [Polar Perlin noise loop](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/136.1-polar-perlin-noise-loops.html)

Code snippets I'm direclty inspired from, if any, are mentioned in the comments of the code
