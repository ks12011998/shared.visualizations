# shared.visualizations

In this repository, I will share the source code of some `p5.js` visualizations from my **[portfolio](https://www.lorismat.com)**, along with some data processing, mostly in `python`.  

The source code for some of my `d3.js` visualizations is shared on my **[Observable](https://observablehq.com/@git1984)** profile.
